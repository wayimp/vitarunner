        Though most in our day view counties as mere provinces and conduits of
        the state and federal governments - counties have the authority and
        power to stop evil, and were meant to do so. They also are meant to
        build and bring order to local communities; and their importance is
        growing as the nation is breaking apart.

      <div>
        Elders have a vital role to play in the resistance of tyranny because
        it’s the truth that makes us free (John 8:32), however, people need to
        be taught what this means. Tyranny thrives on ignorance and being
        unchallenged, thus elders are called to equip the saints to stand
        against darkness and advance the truth, righteousness and justice of
        Christ’s Kingdom.

          31 years, 29 of which have been at the Morgantown Family Practice
          located in Pennsylvania. He grew up along the Amazon River as a

          Dr. Donaldson practices in a modified concierge practice that focuses
          on mitigating cardiovascular inflammation through the Bale Doneen
          method. This background prepared him in successfully treating COVID-19
          patients as it is a cardiovascular inflammatory illness.

          Dr. Donaldson has helped many patients stay at home to avoid the
          hospital. He has been able to pull patients from the emergency rooms
          and treat them at home when the ER doctors wanted to admit them. He
          has also worked on some treatments for the long haulers of COVID-19

          multi-disciplinary group of physicians focusing on alternative
          approaches to care delivery and a different paradigm approach to
          medical care both for those suffering from the illness as well as

          As a young child in war-torn Germany, Mike’s mother foraged for
          dandelion leaves and other wild edibles to help feed her family after
          Eastern soldiers left them to starve. This experience and growing up
          around agriculture in California led Mike’s family to grow their own
          vegetables and fruit.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Years later, as a missionary in Romania shortly after the collapse of
          Communism, Mike witnessed firsthand the challenges of the lingering
          Socialist-centralized food distribution system. He learned many
          valuable lessons from the Romanian people in how to survive and
          thrive. As a result of these experiences and because of personal
          health crises, Mike and his family established a 24-acre Certified
          Naturally Grown farm.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Mike has had many years of experience and study of the international
          supply and transportation of food. He is adept in the logistics of
          food production, acquisition, distribution, security, and four-season
          growing.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently living in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Mike and his family grow
          much of their food on their 1/4 acre homestead. He now works as a
          consultant to farmers, churches, and individuals wanting to improve
          their skills in homesteading, gardening, permaculture, and other
          practical ways to handle the current food crisis.
